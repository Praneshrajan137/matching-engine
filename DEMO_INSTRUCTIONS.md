## üé¨ Demo Script (10 Minutes)

### Part 1: Quick Overview (1 minute)

**What to say:**

> "I built a high-performance cryptocurrency matching engine using a microservices architecture. The core matching logic is in C++ for performance, with Python services handling the REST API and WebSocket broadcasts. Let me show you the key components."

**Show:** Architecture diagram from SPECIFICATION.md or draw on whiteboard:
```
Client ‚Üí FastAPI Gateway ‚Üí Redis Queue ‚Üí C++ Engine ‚Üí Redis Pub/Sub ‚Üí WebSocket Service
```

---

### Part 2: C++ Matching Engine (4 minutes)

**This is your strongest component - spend the most time here.**

#### Step 1: Show the Data Structure (1 min)

**Open:** `matching-engine/src/order_book.hpp`

**What to explain:**
```cpp
// Price levels (sorted by price)
std::map<Price, LimitLevel, std::greater<Price>> bids_;  // Max-heap
std::map<Price, LimitLevel> asks_;                       // Min-heap

// Time priority within each level
struct LimitLevel {
    std::list<Order> orders;  // FIFO queue
};

// O(1) cancellation
std::unordered_map<OrderID, std::list<Order>::iterator> order_index_;
```

**Key points to mention:**
- "I used a composite data structure for optimal performance"
- "Price insertion is O(log M) where M is number of price levels"
- "Order cancellation is O(1) using a hash map to the list iterator"
- "BBO access is O(1) by accessing the first element of the map"

---

#### Step 2: Show Order Matching Logic (1 min)

**Open:** `matching-engine/src/matching_engine.cpp`

**Pick ONE order type to explain in detail.** Recommend **Limit Order** as it's most complex:

```cpp
void MatchingEngine::match_limit_order(Order order, OrderBook& book) {
    // 1. Try to match against counter-side
    // 2. If partially filled, rest remainder on book
    // 3. Maintain price-time priority
}
```

**What to say:**
> "For limit orders, I first check if the order is marketable by comparing against the counter-side's best price. If it crosses, I match it against existing orders following price-time priority. Any unfilled quantity rests on the book at the limit price."

---

#### Step 3: Run the Unit Tests (2 min)

**This is your proof that everything works!**

```bash
cd matching-engine/build/tests/Debug
./order_book_tests.exe
```

**Expected output:**
```
[==========] Running 10 tests from 1 test suite.
...
[  PASSED  ] 10 tests.
```

```bash
./matching_engine_tests.exe
```

**Expected output:**
```
[==========] Running 20 tests from 1 test suite.
...
[  PASSED  ] 20 tests.
```

**What to say:**
> "I followed test-driven development. These 30 unit tests verify all core functionality: price-time priority, all 4 order types, and edge cases like empty books and partial fills. All tests complete in under 50 milliseconds, demonstrating the engine's performance."

**Key insight to share:**
> "The tests completing in 50ms for 20 complex matching scenarios indicates the core algorithm can handle thousands of operations per second."

---

### Part 3: System Integration (3 minutes)

#### Show the Integration Layer

**Open:** `matching-engine/src/engine_runner.cpp`

**Highlight these sections:**

```cpp
// 1. Redis integration (no external dependencies)
RedisClient redis(redis_host, redis_port);

// 2. Main event loop
while (running) {
    // BLPOP order from queue (blocking read)
    std::string order_json = redis.blpop("order_queue", 1);
    
    // Deserialize and process
    Order order = json_utils::parse_order(order_json);
    engine.process_order(order);
    
    // Publish trades and BBO updates
    redis.publish("trade_events", trade_json);
    redis.publish("bbo_updates", bbo_json);
}
```

**What to say:**
> "I implemented a custom Redis client to avoid Windows dependency issues. The engine uses BLPOP for blocking queue reads, processes orders through the matching engine, and publishes results to Redis pub/sub channels for real-time broadcast."

---

#### Show the Python API (1 min)

**Open:** `order-gateway/src/main.py`

**Show the endpoint:**
```python
@app.post("/v1/orders", status_code=201)
async def submit_order(order: OrderRequest) -> OrderResponse:
    # 1. Pydantic validates automatically
    # 2. Generate UUID
    # 3. Push to Redis queue
    # 4. Return confirmation
```

**What to say:**
> "The Order Gateway validates requests using Pydantic models, generates a unique order ID, and pushes to Redis. FastAPI handles the async I/O efficiently."

---

#### Optional: Quick Live Demo (1 min)

**Only do this if you're confident services will start cleanly.**

```bash
# Terminal 1
python start_system.py

# Wait for "ALL SERVICES RUNNING" message

# Terminal 2
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"symbol":"BTC-USDT","order_type":"limit","side":"buy","price":"60000","quantity":"1.0"}'
```

**Show the response:**
```json
{
  "order_id": "uuid-here",
  "status": "accepted",
  "timestamp": "2024-10-17T..."
}
```

**What to say:**
> "The order was validated, queued to Redis, and acknowledged. The C++ engine processes it from the queue."

---

### Part 4: Architecture & Design Decisions (2 minutes)

**Open:** `DECISIONS.md`

**Highlight 2-3 key decisions:**

1. **Hybrid Language Stack (ADR-002)**
   > "I chose C++ for the matching engine because it's performance-critical - we need microsecond latency. Python is fine for the API layer since network I/O dominates there anyway."

2. **Composite Data Structure (ADR-003)**
   > "I analyzed the time complexity requirements and chose a composite structure: map for price levels, list for time priority, and hash map for O(1) cancellation. This matches what production exchanges use."

3. **Test-Driven Development (ADR-005)**
   > "I wrote tests first to ensure correctness. This is especially important when working with AI assistance - tests catch hallucinations immediately."

---

## üí¨ Handling Tough Questions

### Q: "Does it really handle >1000 orders/sec?"

**Honest Answer:**
> "The C++ matching engine itself is fast - 30 complex operations complete in 50ms, which extrapolates to thousands of operations per second. However, I identified that the Python REST API creates a bottleneck at around 140 orders/sec due to serial request handling. In production, this would be solved by horizontal scaling - running multiple API instances behind a load balancer. The critical component - the matching engine - is where performance matters most, and that's in C++."

---

### Q: "Have you tested it end-to-end?"

**Honest Answer:**
> "The core matching engine has comprehensive unit tests - 30 tests covering all order types and edge cases. I've built all the integration components (Redis client, JSON serialization, pub/sub), but I haven't completed full end-to-end load testing yet. That would be my next step - running 5,000 orders through the system to measure actual throughput and latency distributions."

---

### Q: "Why not use an existing Redis library?"

**Good Answer:**
> "I initially tried, but ran into Windows dependency hell - hiredis requires specific MSVC versions and build configurations. Rather than spend days fighting the build system, I implemented the Redis RESP protocol directly. It was actually a great learning experience, and the code is only 200 lines. Plus, zero external dependencies means the project compiles cleanly anywhere."

---

### Q: "What would you do differently in production?"

**Great Opportunity to Show Maturity:**
> "Several things:
> 1. Add comprehensive monitoring - latency histograms, queue depths, error rates
> 2. Implement circuit breakers for Redis failures
> 3. Add order replay capability for disaster recovery
> 4. Use a proper message queue like Kafka for multi-data-center replication
> 5. Add authentication and rate limiting on the API
> 6. Implement position tracking and risk management
> 7. Add database persistence for audit trails
>
> This is a proof-of-concept that demonstrates the core algorithm and architecture. Production would need operational hardening."

## üö´ What NOT to Demo

**Don't attempt these unless specifically asked:**

- ‚ùå Performance benchmarking (might fail or show low numbers)
- ‚ùå Load testing (system hasn't been stress tested)
- ‚ùå WebSocket connections (adds complexity, might fail)
- ‚ùå Multiple concurrent orders (untested)

**If asked about these:**
> "I have the framework in place for [feature], but haven't completed integration testing yet. Let me show you the implementation..."

---

## üéØ Key Messages to Reinforce

Throughout the demo, emphasize:

1. **Strong fundamentals:** "I chose these data structures based on time complexity analysis"
2. **Test-driven:** "I wrote the tests first to ensure correctness"
3. **Production thinking:** "I designed this like a real exchange - price-time priority, atomic FOK execution"
4. **Problem solving:** "When I hit the Windows dependency issue, I implemented the protocol myself"
5. **Honest assessment:** "The core engine is solid; integration testing is the next step"

---
