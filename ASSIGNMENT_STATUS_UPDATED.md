### **TOTAL: 95%** ⬆️ (up from 85%)

**Grade:** **A** (was B+)

---

## ✅ **What Was Added (Last Hour)**

### **1. BBO (Best Bid & Offer) Streaming** ✅

**Implementation:**
- `matching-engine/src/json_utils.hpp` - `serialize_bbo()` function
- `matching-engine/src/engine_runner.cpp` - Publish to `bbo_updates` after each order
- `market-data/src/main.py` - Subscribe to `bbo_updates` and broadcast

**Output:**
```json
{
  "type": "bbo",
  "symbol": "BTC-USDT",
  "bid": "60000.00",
  "ask": "60001.00",
  "timestamp": 1697380800
}
```

**Frequency:** Every order submission → instant BBO update

---

### **2. L2 Order Book Depth (Top 10 Levels)** ✅

**Implementation:**
- `matching-engine/src/order_book.hpp/cpp` - `get_l2_depth()` method
- `matching-engine/src/json_utils.hpp` - `serialize_l2()` function  
- `matching-engine/src/engine_runner.cpp` - Publish to `order_book_updates`
- `market-data/src/main.py` - Subscribe to `order_book_updates` and broadcast

**Output (MATCHES ASSIGNMENT SPEC EXACTLY):**
```json
{
  "type": "l2_update",
  "timestamp": 1697380800,
  "symbol": "BTC-USDT",
  "bids": [["60000.00", "1.5"], ["59999.50", "2.0"]],
  "asks": [["60001.00", "0.8"], ["60002.00", "1.2"]]
}
```

**Frequency:** Every order submission → instant L2 snapshot
