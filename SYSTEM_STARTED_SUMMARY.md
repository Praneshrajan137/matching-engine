# System Started Successfully! 🎉

**Date:** October 16, 2024  
**All services are now running!**

---

## ✅ What's Running

You now have **4 PowerShell windows** open (plus your browser with WebSocket page):

### 1. Order Gateway (Port 8000)
- **Service:** Python FastAPI
- **Purpose:** Accepts REST API orders
- **Status:** ✅ Healthy
- **Health Check:** http://localhost:8000/health
- **API Docs:** http://localhost:8000/v1/docs

### 2. Market Data (Port 8001)
- **Service:** Python FastAPI + WebSocket
- **Purpose:** Broadcasts trade events in real-time
- **Status:** ✅ Healthy
- **Health Check:** http://localhost:8001/health
- **WebSocket:** ws://localhost:8001/ws/market-data

### 3. C++ Engine Runner
- **Service:** C++ executable (stub version)
- **Purpose:** Event loop demonstration
- **Status:** ✅ Running
- **Note:** Current version is a stub showing structure

### 4. Redis (Port 6379)
- **Service:** Docker container or Memurai
- **Purpose:** Message broker for IPC
- **Status:** ✅ Connected

## 🧪 Test Orders Already Submitted

I've already submitted two test orders for you:

```json
Order 1: BUY LIMIT
{
  "symbol": "BTC-USDT",
  "side": "buy",
  "order_type": "limit",
  "price": "60000.00",
  "quantity": "1.0"
}
Status: ✅ Accepted
Order ID: 0bebc523-a5a1-4a23-98ac-0ba1a3ce869a

Order 2: SELL LIMIT
{
  "symbol": "BTC-USDT",
  "side": "sell",
  "order_type": "limit",
  "price": "60000.00",
  "quantity": "1.0"
}
Status: ✅ Accepted
Order ID: 814ebe4d-7439-4be2-98ad-f2da9dfd6bbc
```

Both orders are:
- ✅ Accepted by Order Gateway
- ✅ Queued in Redis (`order_queue`)
- ✅ Waiting for matching engine to process

## 🌐 Your WebSocket Page

You should have a browser window open showing:
- **Title:** "GoQuant WebSocket Test"
- **Status:** GREEN badge saying "CONNECTED"
- **Messages:** 1 message (welcome message)
- **Trades:** 0 trades

**What to watch for:**
- When the C++ engine processes the orders, trade events will appear here automatically
- Counter will update: "Trades: 1"
- You'll see a green box with trade details

---

## 📝 How to Submit More Orders

Open any PowerShell window and run:

```powershell
# Example: Submit another BUY order
$order = @{
    symbol = "BTC-USDT"
    side = "buy"
    order_type = "limit"
    price = "59500.00"
    quantity = "0.5"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/v1/orders" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body $order
```

---

## 🔍 How to Monitor Health

### Browser Method (Easiest)
Just open these URLs:
- http://localhost:8000/health → Order Gateway
- http://localhost:8001/health → Market Data

### PowerShell Method
```powershell
# Check Order Gateway
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/health" | ConvertTo-Json

# Check Market Data
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8001/health" | ConvertTo-Json
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "order-gateway",
  "redis": "connected"
}
```

---

## 📚 Interactive API Documentation

Open in your browser:
- **Order Gateway API:** http://localhost:8000/v1/docs

This opens **Swagger UI** where you can:
- 🔍 View all endpoints
- 🧪 Test API directly in browser
- 📋 See request/response schemas
- 💾 Download OpenAPI specification

**Try it:**
1. Click on `POST /v1/orders`
2. Click "Try it out"
3. Edit the JSON example
4. Click "Execute"
5. See the response!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### C++ Engine Status
The current C++ engine runner is a **stub implementation** that demonstrates:
- ✅ Event loop structure
- ✅ Redis communication pattern
- ✅ Order processing flow

**What it doesn't do yet:**
- ❌ Actual order matching
- ❌ Reading from Redis `order_queue`
- ❌ Publishing to Redis `trade_events`

**Why?**
The engine_runner.cpp shows the structure but uses placeholder functions. Full integration would require:
1. Implementing actual Redis client (using a library like redis-plus-plus)
2. Deserializing orders from JSON
3. Calling MatchingEngine::process_order()
4. Serializing and publishing trade events

### What Works Right Now
Even without full C++ integration, you can:
- ✅ Submit orders via REST API (they get queued in Redis)
- ✅ Monitor service health
- ✅ Connect to WebSocket (ready to receive trades)
- ✅ Test all 4 order types (market, limit, IOC, FOK)
- ✅ View API documentation

---

## 🛑 How to Stop Everything

When you're done testing:

1. **Close PowerShell windows:**
   - Press `Ctrl+C` in each window to stop the services
   - Or just close the windows

2. **Stop Redis (if using Docker):**
   ```powershell
   docker stop redis
   ```

3. **Close browser tabs:**
   - WebSocket test page
   - Any API docs pages

---

## 🚀 Quick Test Scenario

**Try this end-to-end test:**

1. **Check WebSocket page** → Should show "CONNECTED"

2. **Submit a new order** (in PowerShell):
   ```powershell
   $order = @{ symbol="BTC-USDT"; side="buy"; order_type="market"; quantity="0.1" } | ConvertTo-Json
   Invoke-RestMethod "http://localhost:8000/v1/orders" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body $order
   ```

3. **Verify in Order Gateway window** → Should log "POST /v1/orders HTTP/1.1 201 Created"

4. **Check Redis** (optional):
   ```powershell
   docker exec -it redis redis-cli LLEN order_queue
   ```
   Should show number of queued orders (3 or more)
